<body>
Punjabi kabaddi, also called circle style kabaddi,[1] is a contact sport that originated in the Punjab region, in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. There are a number of traditional Punjabi kabaddi styles traditionally played in the Punjab region. Like standard kabaddi, circle style kabaddi is played at state and international levels,[2] through various governing bodies such as Kabaddi World Cup (Circle style).<p>The term kabaddi may be derived from the Punjabi word "kauddi" (Punjabi: ਕੌਡੀ) which is chanted to play kabaddi or, it is derived from "katta" (calf) (Punjabi: ਕੱਟਾ) and "vaddi" (to chopped) (Punjabi: ਵੱਢੀ) which together has become kabaddi.<br><br><br>
